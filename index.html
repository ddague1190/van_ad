      <h1>1990 Ford Econoline E350 just under 50k miles</h1>
      <h4>About this van</h4>
      <p>
        Retired police surveillance vehicle operating for the BSO (south
        florida). Civilian use dates to 2017 or so when retired police officer
        bought it. He sold it to me. Here is ad from when I bought it:

      </p>
      <p>Cargo area is fully insulated.</p>
      <p>
        Camper conversion features are pretty much self evident from pictures.
      </p>
      <div class="feature_section">
        <p>Some quick notes on conversion...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Composting toilet is effect, with fan on no detection of odors using
            coconut choir
          </li>
          <li>400w solar into lithium battery</li>
          <li>
            Will consider including a small, low-draw 12V ac unit which I have
            not installed yet (I did some testing and it will cool a portion of
            the cargo area at night)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>What have I done mechanically for van?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Exterior professional body paint</li>
        <li>
          All new AC (Evaporator, all lines, compressor, condensor, accumulator,
          orfice tube, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
          New tires Nov 2021 (mileage since then around 4k); steel wheels were
          professionally powder coated black with sparkles
        </li>
        <li>New fuel system (tanks, pumps, hoses)</li>
        <li>
          New alternator, starter, battery, relays, alternator, ignition system,
          and new wiring in some places
        </li>
        <li>Harness inspection and rewrap</li>
        <li>New vacuum hoses</li>
        <li>Brakes all around and front struts</li>
        <li>New antismog pump</li>
        <li>
          Coolant flush, new T-stat and housing, replaced all hoses, bypassed
          heater core to increase AC efficiency [can revert; I have valves and
          distribution block for a manual bypass setup]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Who should buy this van?</h4>
      <p>
        Would I drive it across country now? Yes without hesitation. Two months
        ago I drove it from Miami without slightest issue. Using both tanks, the
        distance between gas stations can be stretched to 400+ miles. Last
        December I did another 3k mile trip with the van to visit some camping
        spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, the person who buys the van should have experience or
        interest in fixing minor issues. I have all the factory and haynes
        service manuals. And can provide assistance via phone or in person if
        needed. I think I fixed/replaced my way out of all of the failing-old-part related problems now anyway.
